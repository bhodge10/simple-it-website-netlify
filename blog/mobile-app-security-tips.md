Mobile applications are a core part of our daily business activities, allowing us to reach online programs, communicate from anywhere, and access stored data. However, these apps can also expose us to cyber risks, with fraudsters attempting to steal personal information and contacts, access critical business networks, or harm our devices.

According to [2024 data from Asee, over 75% of published apps contain at least one security vulnerability](https://cybersecurity.asee.io/blog/mobile-app-statistics-to-keep-an-eye-on/). To stay safe, it's crucial to take precautions when downloading and managing apps. Read on for our 10 simple tips to help protect your mobile apps and data.

#### **First, Why Is Mobile App Security Important?**

The risks of mobile app security are significant, especially for small businesses, mid-sized companies, and government agencies that rely on mobile apps for daily operations. Business apps are three times more likely to leak login credentials. Even popular apps with millions of downloads can have security flaws.

Hackers and criminals exploit weaknesses in app permissions, insecure internet connections, and outdated software to steal data. As an experienced Managed Service Provider (MSP) serving Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, Simple IT specializes in cybersecurity for businesses and government agencies, with an important part being to maintain mobile app security. Here are some tips we follow to help reduce risks.

#### **Top 10 Mobile App Security Tips for Users**

Mobile apps can be risky, but by following these tips and sharing them within your organization, you can take a proactive approach to better protect your devices and data:

- **Download Only from Official Stores**
Always download apps from trusted sources like the **Google Play Store** or **Apple App Store**. These platforms vet apps for security. Avoid downloading from third-party sites, which may offer fake or malicious apps.

- **Check App Ratings and Reviews**
Before installing an app, review its user ratings and feedback. If there are frequent complaints about security issues, avoid downloading it. Checking reviews helps assess the app's reliability and safety.

- **Review App Permissions**
Apps request access to various parts of your phone, such as your location, camera, or contacts. Always evaluate whether the app truly needs that information. Apps requesting excessive permissions may compromise your privacy and security.

- **Update Your Phone’s Operating System**
Keeping your phone’s operating system up to date is vital for mobile device management. Security updates patch vulnerabilities, making it harder for attackers to exploit your device.

- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**
Create strong passwords for each app by combining letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Password security is essential in protecting your data, especially for business apps.

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your apps. This feature requires a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) to access accounts, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Apps**
Public Wi-Fi networks are not secure. Avoid using them for important tasks such as banking or accessing sensitive business apps. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for a safer connection.

- **Log Out of Apps When Not in Use**
Always log out of apps, especially those that store sensitive data like banking or email apps. This ensures that your personal information is protected if your phone is lost or stolen.

- **Update Your Apps Regularly**
App developers frequently release updates to fix security flaws. Keep your apps up to date to ensure you're using the most secure versions, reducing the risk of exploitation.

- **Enable Built-in Security Features**
Many apps offer additional security features like fingerprint recognition or face ID. Enable these features to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.
