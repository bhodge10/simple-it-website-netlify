Smart homes used to just be something straight out of a sci-fi movie, but now they’re our new reality right here in Northern Kentucky. Lights respond to our voice and thermostats auto-adjust, while robot vacuums clean the floors while we relax.

It's all very inviting. But before you rush out and buy the newest gadget, there are some crucial considerations. Here are 7 essential things to ask yourself before diving headfirst into new smart home tech.

## 1. Does it Solve a Real Problem?

Not all smart home devices are created equal. Some offer genuine solutions to everyday problems. Others might be more novelty than necessity. Think critically about your daily routine. Identify tasks that you could streamline with smart technology, as well as those where additional asset management won’t be worth the time.

For instance, do you constantly forget to turn off the lights when you leave a room? Then, smart bulbs with motion sensors could be a game-changer. But a $300 smart toaster might not be the most practical addition to your kitchen. Especially if your mornings are already a hectic rush.

## 2. Is It Compatible with Other Devices?

The world of smart home devices can be a bit like a high school cafeteria. Not all device brands play well together. Many smart devices rely on a central hub or app to function. So, ensure the gadget you choose is compatible with the ones you already have or plan to buy. 

Mixing and matching brands can lead to a frustrating user experience. Devices may refuse to communicate or need several apps to manage. Researching compatibility beforehand will save you a lot of headaches. 

PS: Help is on the way in the future. A new [Matter standard aims to address cross-brand compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)).

## 3. Is Your Wi-Fi Up to the Challenge?

Smart homes can grow to be data-hungry beasts. They rely heavily on a strong network management environment and stable Wi-Fi connection to maintain functional continuity. Is your internet slow, unreliable, or have limited bandwidth? If so, your smart home dreams might quickly turn into a frustrating and sluggish nightmare. 

Just a few of the potential problems you might face with a weak Wi-Fi connection are:

-

-

Smart lights flickering on and off

-

Thermostats refusing to adjust

-

Voice assistants lagging behind your commands

Before investing in smart devices, consider upgrading your Wi-Fi router or internet plan. This helps ensure it can handle the increased data traffic.

## 4. Privacy Concerns Deserve Attention

Smart home devices collect data on your habits and routines and learn from this data through cloud back-up. From the times you turn on the lights to the temperature you prefer at bedtime. These gadgets are constantly gathering information. Some companies may then use this data to personalize your experience. But others might sell it to third-party vendors (usually advertisers).

Before bringing a smart device into your home, take time to read the device's privacy policy. What data does it collect? How is it used? Do you have any control over how your data is shared and settings to opt-out of sharing data? Does the privacy policy raise red flags or concerns of identity and access management? Is Multi-Factor Authentication (also known as Two-Step Authentication) in-place when accessing or logging into the device?  If anything looks suspicious to raise your security awareness training, then it might be best to consider a different device with more robust data protection and data encryption practices.

5. Security Matters: Protect Your Smart Home

Unfortunately, the convenience of smart homes also comes with an increased security risk. These devices connect to your Wi-Fi network. This means they can become vulnerable to hacking attempts or prone to cybersecurity threats. Hackers could potentially gain access to your home's network controls through a single device, as well adjust settings, steal sensitive data, log-in with your identity to access personal information, or install ransomware.

To mitigate these risks, choose devices with strong security features and maintain network security with password management and protection, data encryption and two-factor authentication. Additionally, keep your devices updated with the latest software patches which is often a toggled setting where updates are pushed to the device. It’s also crucial to address and report any known security vulnerabilities or suspected data breaches should they happen. Consider creating a separate “guest” Wi-Fi network for your smart home devices. This type of vulnerability management isolates them from your personal computers, phones and other data-rich devices for an extra layer of security.

6. Future-Proofing Your Smart Home

Technology evolves at a rapid pace. What's cutting-edge today might be obsolete tomorrow. Before investing in a smart home device, consider the manufacturer's reputation and their asset management of earlier released products. You should look for details on software updates and their frequency, as well as their long-term device support reputation. Will the company continue to provide security patches on items in the years to come, or make them obsolete that you’ll have to buy the latest and greatest (and more expensive) model to maintain continuity?

If a brand lacks a history of consistent software updates, it might be wise to look elsewhere. This helps to ensure your smart home doesn't become outdated quickly or require constant reinvesting to stay functional.

7. Start Small and Scale Up Gradually

Don't get carried away and try to automate your entire home overnight. Smart home technology can be a significant investment. It's wise to take things slow. Start with a few key
devices that address specific needs or pain points in your daily routine and find a brand you like and trust.

For example, consider starting with smart lights or a smart thermostat. These help you experience the benefits of smart home technology, but before diving into a full-blown home automation setup with extensive network management and endpoint detection. This measured approach allows you to assess the usefulness of smart home devices as well as identify any issues before committing to the next investment as you scale over time.

Carefully consider these 7 essential questions before buying smart home devices. They’ll help ensure that your foray into the world of home automation is a success.
