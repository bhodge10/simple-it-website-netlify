In 2025, cyber threats are more prevalent than ever, targeting businesses, employees, devices, networks, clients and more. Whether it’s stealing sensitive data, disrupting business operations, or demanding ransom, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) and government agencies must stay vigilant and prepared as they are commonly the most targeted, and most susceptible.  Simple IT, a trusted IT Managed Service Provider (MSP), specializes in technology support, business continuity, cybersecurity, and on-premises access security to help organizations across various industries in Northern Kentucky stay protected.

## What Are the Most Common Cyber Threats?

Cyber threats come in many forms, some old, some new, and are always evolving. Here are five common threats businesses and their employees should be aware of and watching for:

### Phishing Attacks

[Phishing attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/phishing-attack/) remain one of the most effective cyber threats. Cybercriminals trick users into revealing personal and business-sensitive information through deceptive emails, fake websites, or fraudulent phone calls. **How to protect yourself:**

Educate employees on how to recognize phishing attempts with regularly conducted Cyber Security Awareness Training and testing

Always verify the sender’s email address as one you recognize, and check into it further if it’s not one you know for certain to be safe

Do not click on suspicious links or download unexpected attachments, check with the recipient who sent it to you… they may be compromised and not aware

### Ransomware

Ransomware attacks lock critical business data or systems, then demand payment for their release. SMBs are especially vulnerable due to limited cybersecurity defenses, and government agencies are attractive targets because of the volume of sensitive data they hold. **How to stay protected:**

Deploy robust endpoint security solutions to protect the device and prevent it becoming the pathway in to your network

Keep your software and systems updated to the newest and most secure version

Regularly back up your files to a secure and offsite location, consider an automated back-up solution or cloud storage tool to confirm this important step

### Malware

Malicious software (malware) can damage computers, steal sensitive information, and disrupt business operations. **Prevention measures include:**

Keeping systems and applications patched against known vulnerabilities

Installing enterprise-grade antivirus and anti-malware software

Avoiding downloads from untrusted sources

### Business Email Compromise (BEC)

Hackers infiltrate or spoof legitimate business email accounts to steal funds or sensitive data. **To prevent BEC:**

Implement email authentication measures such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC

Train employees to recognize and report suspicious emails… consider your employees as the front-line defense and train them well

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email accounts to protect identities and access

### Insider Threats

Not all threats come from outside the organization. Disgruntled employees or unintentional mistakes can lead to data breaches. **Best practices to reduce insider threats:**

Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to prevent staff from accessing data or programs which aren’t necessary for their job role

Conduct regular security awareness training and network scans

Control password use with a Password Manager where passwords are securely protected and shared with time-based access and administrator controls to remove access by a specific person or group of people quickly

## How Can You Protect Your Business Online?

Businesses must take a proactive approach to cybersecurity. Simple IT recommends these best practices:

### Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Create complex, unique passwords for each account

Enable MFA to add an extra layer of security

Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems with monitoring, alerts and managed reporting

Segment networks so sensitive data and key business systems aren’t accessible by public or guest networks, allow access to key networks only to those employees who need it to perform their job requirements

Deploy Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions with continuous monitoring, alerts and detailed reporting

**Change Passwords Immediately:** Secure compromised accounts with strong passwords

**Isolate Affected Systems:** Prevent further spread of malware and viruses by quarantining the impacted device by removing it from the network and turning it off

**Back-Up Critical Data:**  Ensure your important data and the information you’ll need to recover swiftly is saved to a safe and trusted device, like a flash or external hard drive, or encrypted cloud storage

## Future Cyber Threats: What’s Next?

The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving. Businesses should be prepared for:

**Supply Chain Attacks:** Bad actors infiltrating businesses to assume employee identities and email accounts in order to trick trusted vendors or clients into making unverified payments, or providing bank and credit accounts
