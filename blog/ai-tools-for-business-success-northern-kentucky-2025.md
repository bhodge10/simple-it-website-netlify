Walk into any IT department right now, and you’ll likely hear something like this: “How can we better integrate AI?  It’s going to be a game-changer, so we can’t be late to act.”

The market is buzzing with both promise and hype. A recent McKinsey survey shows that [78% of companies now use AI in some form](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), and that number is climbing fast.

Plenty of AI tools can cut workloads, automate processes, and keep teams “future-proofed.” Some truly help, while others feel rushed just to ride the wave. For small businesses, government agencies, and non-profits in Northern Kentucky, knowing what tools can help you best, easiest and most quickly can be the difference between wasting time with a dud, or quickly capitalizing from the benefits of a winning solution.

## **Why is AI Different in 2025?**

AI isn’t brand new, but in the last two years it’s taken huge strides forward and has quickly become part of our everyday business technology. Models have become better at understanding context, generating original content, and working across formats.  With those significant gains, more technology providers have infused AI into their devices, software and applications.

The three primary technologies driving the growth of AI are:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Systems which improve with every dataset. This is why your online recommendations and the social media you see are so spot-on.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This is what allows a system to understand when you ask in normal language, as compared to complicated code queries.

- **Generative AI:** The creative engine that can work from huge amounts of known data to produce a clearly written paragraph, a well themed image, or even a video that’s hard to tell if it’s real or not, all from scratch with your simple commands.

The “multimodal” wave, where one tool can handle text, images, audio, and video, is what has made AI become more practical for everyday operations. It’s why even cautious IT leaders are giving it a look, if only to better understand its huge potential.

## **What are Some AI Tool Categories Worth Knowing for NKY Businesses?**

Tracking every AI launch is impossible at the rate they’re being introduced, so it helps to [group AI tools into a few broad categories](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-productivity-tools/), and then focus on the ones which matter most.

### **1. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**

These are smarter than the bots of years past:

- **Microsoft Copilot** automates tasks in Word, Excel, and Teams, boosting productivity for businesses already using Microsoft 365. [Watch this short video](https://youtu.be/4VMeKXAFggc?si=n5S9lihQvAEJA6Sv) which does a great job of showing Microsoft Copilot's capabilities in an easy to understand manner.

- **Google Gemini** integrates directly into Google applications like Gmail, Sheets, and Docs, as well as the Google Chrome browser.

- **ChatGPT** now works with images, audio, and live conversation (but may require a paid subscription for certain capabilities).

- **Grok AI** specializes in problem-solving and data-heavy reasoning.

### **2. Content Creation**

For marketing, proposals, or documentation:

- **Jasper AI** focuses on marketers, with SEO features built in.

- **Anyword** fine-tunes tone for different audiences.

- **Writer** keeps large brands consistent.

### **3. Image and Design**

AI visuals are now practical for business use:

- **Midjourney** for artistic graphics.

- **Stable Diffusion** for full creative control.

- **DALL·E 3** for simple edits inside ChatGPT.

- **Google Imagen 3** for precise, multilingual prompts.

- **Adobe Firefly** for safe, commercial-friendly content.

### **4. Video and Storytelling**

Useful for training, onboarding, or marketing:

- **Runway ML** combines image and video generation.

- **Descript** and **Filmora** make editing simple.

### **5. Search and Research**

Great for digging into information:

- **Perplexity AI** blends live search with summaries.

- **Arc Search** speeds up research with instant overviews.

### **6. Productivity and Collaboration**

Quiet workhorse tools that save hours:

- **Notion AI** and **Mem** organize knowledge.

- **Asana, Any.do, BeeDone** for task management.

- **Fireflies, Avoma** for automated meeting notes.

- **Reclaim, Clockwise** for smarter calendars.

- **Shortwave, Gemini** for tidier inboxes.

## **Where Can NKY Businesses Win with AI?**

The real benefit isn’t just “using AI.” It’s integrating AI into your business and the other programs you depend on, like your CRM, Email, Teams, and even your phones, so it can actually make work easier, faster, and better for your team, and your clients.

Common challenges to know when incorporating AI:

- **Integration:** An AI tool could be worthless, and cost more time, if it doesn’t connect and play nice with your key systems.

- **Accuracy:** AI can make mistakes, especially in the early phases of integration, so fact-checking and making corrections will likely be necessary early on.

- **Security:** Data handling rules, settings, and permissions should be in-place before client info is shared.

- **Adoption:** Tools can fail whey the folks who are supposed to use them aren’t trained to know how or why to use them, so plan some time to train and adapt.

## **So, What’s a Simple Way of Getting Started With AI?**

If you’re considering AI for your business, here’s a simple approach to begin:

- Pick one problem that’s slowing your business down, or could make it better.

- Identify two or three tools that target that specific issue or opportunity.

- Check how they integrate with the key systems your business depends on.

- Roll out the selected tool gradually, maybe a few employees of workflows at a time.

Loading up a handful of new tools at once will lead to frustration. Start small, measure results, see what works (and what doesn’t work), and expand from there.

## **Final Thoughts**

AI is not going away. The tools available to businesses right now are powerful, but it's important to remember AI isn’t magic. We suggest to think of AI and the tools you consider like a new hire: they can be amazing, but they need a plan that will call for time, guidance, direction, feedback and a clear understanding of the desired outcomes that will measure their success.
