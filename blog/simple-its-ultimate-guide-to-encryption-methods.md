Encryption is a powerful method of securing information by converting readable data into secret code. With encryption, only the right key can decode the information. This ultimate guide, brought to you by Simple IT – Northern Kentucky’s trusted IT Support & CyberSecurity experts – will help you understand and implement the best encryption methods for your business or government agency.

## **What is Encryption?**

[Encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/) acts like a secret language for your data. It transforms plain, readable text into unreadable ciphertext. Only those with the correct key can decrypt it back into plain text. Encryption is an important element to help ensure the privacy and security of your sensitive information.

## **Why Do We Use Encryption?**

Encryption is vital for keeping your data safe from hackers and unauthorized access. Businesses in Northern Kentucky and beyond, like financial services, health care providers, and government agencies use encryption to:

- Ensure compliance with data security regulations

- Protect confidential client information

- Safeguard financial transactions

## **How Does Encryption Work?**

Encryption relies on algorithms and keys:

- Keys are unique strings of data that unlock the encrypted information.

- Algorithms are sets of rules used to transform data.

## **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption**

There are two main types of encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric.

Symmetric Encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. The same key is shared between the sender and receiver. It can be faster, but may be less secure if the single key is shared improperly.

Asymmetric Encryption uses two keys: a public key and a private key. A public key can encrypt a message, while a private key can decrypt it. The two step process offers greater security because the private key remains confidential.

## **What Are Some Common Encryption Methods?**

There are numerous encryption methods in use today. Here are some of the most common ones:

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES is one of the most secure and widely used symmetric encryption methods. It supports 128, 192, or 256-bit keys, with longer keys providing stronger security.

### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

RSA is a popular asymmetric encryption method. It’s ideal for secure data transmission and is commonly used in digital signatures.

### DES (Data Encryption Standard)

While once widely used, DES’s 56-bit key is now considered outdated. It has largely been replaced by AES.

### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

ECC is an asymmetric encryption technique known for its strong security and efficient performance, especially on mobile devices and IoT systems.

## **How Do We Use Encryption in Everyday Life?**

Encryption is integral to daily life, from securing business operations to protecting personal data:

- Email Security: Encrypting emails, as well specific files when being sent by email, ensures the sensitive information within the message remains confidential.

- Online Shopping: Encrypts payment information to safeguard credit card details.

- Messaging Apps: Platforms like WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption to keep conversations private.

## **What Are the Challenges of Encryption?**

Despite its benefits, encryption presents some challenges:

### Key Management

Losing a key can result in permanent data loss, so safe storage to recall keys is vital.

### Performance Issues

Encrypting and decrypting data requires processing power, which can slow systems or functions down, but that’s a small price to pay in order to keep critical information protected.

## **Simple IT's Tips for Staying Safe with Encryption**

You can take some steps to securely use encryption.

### Use Strong Passwords

Choose complex passwords to enhance security and consider a password manager to help retain them easily and securely.

### Keep Software Updates

Regular updates protect against vulnerabilities by ensuring latest security updates are in-place.

### Use Caution with Public Wi-Fi

If you need to use public Wi-Fi, avoid sensitive transactions unless you can encrypt your internet connection using a VPN.
