Cyberattacks are a constant threat in today's digital world. Phishing emails, malware downloads, and data breaches. They can cripple businesses and devastate personal lives. IT consulting support who can provide your business with robust cybersecurity solutions such as Threat Detection and Incident Response, Firewall Management, Vulnerability Reporting and Management, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) are more critical than ever. Thankfully, Simple IT is a trusted leader for small and medium businesses in the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky area who are looking for local IT Infrastructure Support and Consulting to provide this security.

Employee error is the reason many threats get introduced to a business network. A lack of cybersecurity awareness, cybersecurity training, and documented cybersecurity policies and procedures are generally the culprit. If people don’t know any better, they are more likely to click a phishing link. They also create weak passwords, making it easy for hackers to breach network security services. 

[***It’s estimated that 95% of data breaches are due to human error.***](https://connect.comptia.org/content/articles/the-cost-of-a-breach-10-terrifying-cybersecurity-stats-your-msp-s-customers-need-to-know)

But here's the good news, these mistakes are preventable with the help of tools like a virtual assessment and IT security audit. Building a strong culture of cyber awareness can significantly reduce your risks, while documented business continuity and disaster
recovery policies can help your business remediate and bounce back quickly
should an incident response be necessary.

## Why Culture Matters

Think of your organization's cybersecurity as a chain. Strong links make it unbreakable, while weak links make it vulnerable. Employees are the links in this chain. By fostering a culture of cyber awareness, you turn each employee into a strong link. This makes your entire organization more secure.

## Easy Steps, Big Impact

Building a cyber awareness culture doesn't require complex strategies or expensive training programs. Here are some simple steps you can take to make a big difference.

### 1. Start with Leadership Buy-in

Security shouldn't be an IT department issue alone. Get leadership involved! When executives champion cyber awareness, it sends a powerful message to the organization. Leadership can show their commitment by:

-

-

Participating in training sessions

-

Speaking at security awareness events

-

Allocating resources for ongoing initiatives

### 2. Make Security Awareness Fun, Not Fearful

Cybersecurity training doesn't have to be dry and boring. Through the use of engaging videos, gamified quizzes, and real-life scenarios offered by IT consulting services who specialize in security awareness training employees to stay interested and engaged in learning how to prevent data security threats and security incidents. 

Think of interactive modules. Ones where employees choose their path through a simulated phishing attack. Or short, animated videos. Videos that explain complex security concepts in a clear and relatable way.

### 3. Speak Their Language

Cybersecurity terms can be confusing. Communicate in plain language, avoiding technical jargon. Focus on practical advice employees can use in their everyday work.

Don't say, "implement multi-factor authentication, managed detection and response, or Privileged Access Management." Instead, explain that it adds an extra layer of security when logging in or rules when files are downloaded from internet sites to prevent data security branches. 

### 4. Keep it Short and Sweet

Don't overwhelm people with lengthy day-long training sessions. Instead, opt for more frequent bite-sized training modules that are easy to digest and remember. Use microlearning approaches delivered in short bursts throughout the year or as part of a multi-week employee onboarding process. These are a great way to keep employees engaged while reinforcing key security concepts and a company culture of IT Compliance.

### 5. Conduct Phishing Drills

Regular phishing drills test employee awareness and preparedness to confirm the effectiveness and ongoing need for cybersecurity awareness training. Outsourced Business IT services can send simulated phishing emails and track which of your employees take the bait to click. Use the results to educate employees on red flags, email spanning, anti-virus, network vulnerability, threat detection and how to repost suspicious messages to a remote IT helpdesk or IT service provider for further threat detection and response. 

But don't stop there! After a phishing drill, allow your IT management service provider the opportunity to dissect the email with employees. Highlight the telltale signs that helped identify it as a fake. This will reduce data security and network security
threats in the future, as well help staff return to Microsoft 365 or Google Suite
and remain productive.

### 6. Make Reporting Easy and Encouraged

Employees need to feel comfortable reporting suspicious activity without fear of blame. Create a safe reporting system and acknowledge reports promptly. You can do this through:

-

-

A dedicated email address

-

An anonymous reporting hotline

-

A designated security champion employees can approach directly

### 7. Security Champions: Empower Your Employees

Identify enthusiastic employees who can become "security champions." These champions can answer questions from peers as well as promote best practices through internal communication channels. This keeps security awareness top of mind.

Security champions can be a valuable resource for their colleagues, or they can be an IT consultant or MSP / Managed Service Provider delivering enterprise Managed IT services near you company. Foster a sense of shared responsibility for cybersecurity within the organization.

### 8. Beyond Work: Security Spills Over

Cybersecurity isn't just a work thing. Educate employees on how to protect themselves when working on their mobile devices and at home too. Share tips on Identity and Access Management (IAM), Mobile
Device Management (MDM), Business Password Management Solutions, secure Wi-Fi
connections, and sharing data through public hotspots. Employees who practice
good security habits at home are more likely to do so in the workplace.

 

### 9. Celebrate Successes

Recognize and celebrate employee achievements in cyber awareness. Did someone report a suspicious email? Did a team achieve a low click-through rate on a phishing drill? Publicly acknowledge their contributions to keep motivation high. Recognition can be a powerful tool. It's helps reinforce positive behavior and encourages continued vigilance.

### 10. Bonus Tip: Leverage Technology

IT Support and Technology can be a
powerful tool for building a cyber-aware culture. Use online training platforms
to deliver microlearning modules and track employee progress. Simple IT can
schedule automated phishing simulations regularly to keep employees on their
toes, as well as regularly scheduled cybersecurity awareness training emails. 

Tools that bolster employee security include:

-

-

Password managers

-

Email filtering for spam and phishing

-

Automated rules, [such as Microsoft’s Sensitivity Labels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sensitivity-labels)

-

DNS filtering

## The Bottom Line: Everyone Plays a Role

Building a culture of cyber awareness is
an ongoing process. Repetition is key! Regularly revisit these steps. Keep the
conversation going and consider a remote IT service provider who is
specifically aware and capable to provide cybersecurity solutions in your area.
Make security awareness a natural part of your organization's DNA.

Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. By fostering a culture of cyber awareness your business benefits. You equip everyone in your organization with the knowledge and tools to stay safe online. Empowered employees become your strongest defense against cyber threats.
