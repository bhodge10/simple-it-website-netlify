Let’s face it – cybercriminals are a bunch of dirty dogs, but they're a real threat and getting sneakier by the day. Sure, you’ve heard about their common tricks like phishing scams and cracking passwords, but those are just the tip of the hacker iceberg. At [Simple IT](http://www.simple-it.us), we help businesses across Northern Kentucky stay ahead of the bad guys and their evolving scheming with smart cybersecurity and IT support that keeps systems operating safe and secure.

So buckle up – we’re about to pull back the curtain on seven unexpected ways hackers can get into your business accounts (and how we can help you to keep them out for good).

## Wait, Hackers Can Do What Now?  😲

Technology is awesome – until it’s used against you. Today’s hackers don’t just brute-force passwords or spam your inbox. They exploit the little things folks often overlook. Understanding these sneakier tricks is the first step toward better protection.

Whether you run a small business in Florence, a Non-Profit in Covington, a Wellness Spa in Alexandria, or you serve as the City Administrator somewhere in Kenton, Boone or Campbell County, these tactics can impact your operation, your security, and your bottom line.

## 7 Sneaky Tactics Cybercriminals Use (That You’ve Probably Never Thought About)  🤬

### 1. **Cookie Hijacking**

Cookies make browsing easy by remembering your logins – but they’re also a tasty treat for hackers. If you're using public Wi-Fi without a VPN, cybercriminals could snatch those yummy cookies right out of your browser and then they're off to access your account like it’s their own.

### 2. **SIM Swapping**

Hackers can trick your mobile carrier into transferring your phone number to a new SIM card. That means your text-based two-factor codes could be sent straight to them. It’s a dubious digital heist, and you won’t even know it’s happening until it’s too late.

### 3. **Deepfake Deception**

Imagine getting a video call from your “boss” asking for confidential info – but, nope – it’s actually a deepfake. Sound like sci-fi? It’s real, it’s happening and with how quickly A.I. is advancing it's getting more and more difficult to spot. Deepfake tech even lets attackers impersonate voices or faces with scary accuracy – just scroll through your social media and you're likely to find an [impressive example of a deepfake](https://youtu.be/3wVpVH0Wa6E?si=ldRqWQqV3hl1PemV) or two.

### 4. **Wacky Hijinks with Third-Party Apps**

That harmless little app you connected to your Google or Microsoft 365 account? It might be a backdoor for hackers to jump directly into your mobile device. Many third-party apps don’t meet strong security standards – those are the ones attackers love so they can exploit the weak links.

### 5. **Port-Out Fraud**

Similar to SIM swapping, port-out fraud involves moving your phone number to a new carrier – without your consent or knowledge. Hackers use it to hijack calls, reset passwords, and bypass account protections.  After that, they're off to the races impersonating you and likely putting the dupe on your contacts.

### 6. **Keylogging Malware**

This sneaky software records every key you tap. That means usernames, passwords, emails, phone numbers, and the critical data about your top client that they'd fire you if it ever saw the light of day.  Once it’s left your finger and hit your device, that data is now served up right to the bad guys.

### 7. **AI-Powered Phishing**

Gone are the days of badly written spam emails. Today’s AI-generated phishing messages are polished, persuasive, laser-focused, and highly personalized. They look just like real emails from trusted sources – that's what makes them so believable and especially dangerous.

## Fight Back Without Breaking a Sweat  😎

At Simple IT, we know cybersecurity is real, but it doesn’t have to be scary – or complicated. Here are some smart moves you can make today, or that we'd make for you and your business when we're chummy partners!

- **Upgrade Your MFA Game**
Use app-based or hardware multi-factor authentication instead of text messages. They're way harder for hackers to bypass.

- **Watch Your Accounts Like a Hawk**
Enable login alerts and regularly check your account activity. Suspicious login from Uzbekistan? Might be time to change that password.

- **Skip the Sketchy Wi-Fi**
Avoid public Wi-Fi when handling sensitive data – or, if what you need just can't wait, at least use a reliable VPN to keep snoopers out of your business.

- **Audit Your Apps**
Check which third-party apps are connected to your main accounts. Revoke anything that looks fishy and straight up delete those which you no longer use.

- **Phish-Proof Yourself**
Train yourself and your team to recognize phishing attempts. Think before you click – and when in doubt, verify through a separate channel. (That would be us!)

## Extra Credit: Stay One Step Ahead  🐾

Want to level up your cybersecurity game? Here’s how:

- **Keep Software Updated**
Old software is an open door for hackers. Updates close security holes, so don’t be a lazy bones – stop hitting snooze on those update prompts!

- **Back Up Your Data (Smartly)**
Follow the 3-2-1 rule: three copies of your data, two different formats, one offsite. You’ll thank yourself if ransomware ever comes knocking.

- **Use Encrypted Messaging**
For business-critical info, use secure platforms with end-to-end encryption, password protect key files, and delete what you no longer need.

- **Invest in Cybersecurity Training**
An informed team is your first line of defense, and an uninformed team is your businesses biggest threat. Ongoing training ... it's far more affordable than the costly mistakes (and lawsuits) it can prevent.
