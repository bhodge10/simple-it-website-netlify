Malware and ransomware are two of the most dangerous cybersecurity threats businesses face today. Both can damage your computer systems, steal sensitive data, and disrupt your operations. In 2024, [AVG reports over 60 million new strains of malware were discovered](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/malware-statistics), underscoring the critical need for strong cybersecurity measures to protect your business or government agency.

For small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) and government agencies in Northern Kentucky business communities in Kenton, Boone, Campbell counties and beyond, it's essential to understand these threats. This article explains malware and ransomware, how they work, and how to protect your network and data.

### **What is Malware?**

**Malware** is a broad term that refers to malicious software designed to harm your computer or steal data. It includes a variety of threats, each with different methods of infection and damage. The most common types of malware include:

- **Viruses**: These programs spread from one computer to another, without user knowledge.

- **Worms**: These malware programs replicate themselves and spread across networks.

- **Trojans**: These deceive users by pretending to be legitimate programs, making it easier for attackers to gain access.

- **Spyware**: This software monitors your actions on the computer, stealing personal or business data.

**Malware** can have many negative effects on your systems, such as:

- Slowing down computer performance

- Deleting or corrupting critical files

- Stealing sensitive business or customer data

- Using your system as a launching point for other attacks

### **What is Ransomware?**

**Ransomware** is a specific type of malicious software that locks or encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock them. Essentially, it’s a form of data kidnapping that threatens to hold your business operations hostage.

Ransomware follows a typical pattern:

- It infects your computer, often through phishing emails or malicious downloads.

- It encrypts or locks your files, making them inaccessible.

- A ransom message appears, demanding payment to unlock or decrypt your data.

[In 2024, according to cybersecurity firm Sophos, the average ransom payment was a staggering $2.73 million](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/press/press-releases/2024/04/ransomware-payments-increase-500-last-year-finds-sophos-state), nearly a $1 million increase from the previous year!

There are two main types of ransomware:

- **Locker ransomware**: Locks the entire computer system, preventing use.

- **Crypto ransomware**: Encrypts specific files, making them inaccessible without a decryption key.

### **How Are Malware and Ransomware Different?**

While both malware and ransomware are malicious, their objectives and impact differ significantly. **Malware** aims to cause damage, steal information, or take control of your device, often secretly. **Ransomware**, however, is focused on extortion. It locks or encrypts your files and demands a ransom in exchange for access.

**Malware** often works quietly in the background, while **ransomware** makes its presence known quickly in the attempt to prompt immediate payment.

### **How Does Malware and Ransomware Get onto Your Computer?**

Both malware and ransomware infiltrate your system through various methods, such as:

- **Email attachments**: A common entry point for both types of threats.

- **Phony websites**: Fake sites designed to trick you into downloading malware.

- **USB drives**: Infected devices can spread malware to any computer they connect to.

- **Outdated software**: Unpatched systems are vulnerable to attack.

As technology advances, new forms of attacks are emerging. **Fileless malware**, which doesn’t leave traditional traces, was [expected to increase by 65% in 2024](https://controld.com/blog/malware-statistics-trends/). Additionally, **AI-assisted malware** is estimated to account for 20% of new attacks in 2025.

### **How to Spot Signs of Infection**

Detecting malware or ransomware early can prevent further damage. Here are the typical signs of infection:

- **For Malware**:

Computer performance slows down drastically.

- Unexplained pop-ups appear.

- Programs frequently crash.

- **For Ransomware**:

Files are suddenly inaccessible.

- A ransom note appears on your screen.

- The desktop background changes to a warning message.

### **How Can You Protect Your Business from Malware and Ransomware?**

The best defense against both malware and ransomware is prevention from allowing it to impact you in the first-place. Here are some essential and proactive **cybersecurity tips** for small businesses and government agencies in Northern Kentucky to secure their operations before a costly event.

- **Regular software updates**: Ensure your operating systems and applications are always up to date.

- **Use strong, unique passwords**: Enforce password policies and multi-factor authentication.

- **Avoid suspicious links and attachments**: Never click on unverified links or email attachments, train your staff to do the same.

- **Regular data backups**: Store your data offline, or in a secure cloud environment, to protect against ransomware attacks.

- **Use robust antivirus programs**: Protect your devices from malware infections and have automatic remediation services in-place to swiftly eliminate intrusions.

For businesses facing higher cybersecurity risks, ransomware protection tools and physical on-premises security solutions add extra layers of defense.

### **What to Do If You’re Attacked**

If you suspect a malware or ransomware attack, immediate action is necessary:

Disconnect from the internet to prevent further spread.
