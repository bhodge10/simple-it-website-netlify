Picture this: Your business doors are locked, alarms are set, and your computers are guarded by top-notch firewalls, but a cybercriminal sneaks in through the “side door” via a trusted vendor. Sounds like a bad dream, right? Unfortunately, it’s happening more often than many realize. Criminals are increasingly bypassing direct attacks and instead exploiting weaknesses in the software, services, and suppliers you depend on. For small and mid-sized businesses in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati, it can feel like an impossible challenge… How to protect every link in a complex chain without draining your budget?

That’s where a trusted local IT provider like **[Simple IT](http://www.simple-it.us)**[ ](http://www.simple-it.us)steps in. We give you visibility and control over your entire operation, helping you spot risks early, respond quickly, and keep your operations running smooth and secure.

Cybersecurity reports show that in 2023, [supply chain cyberattacks in the U.S. hit 2,769 entities — a 58% jump from the year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367208/us-annual-number-of-entities-impacted-supply-chain-attacks/) before and the highest total since 2017.

The good news? You don’t have to leave your business exposed. With some smart planning and practical steps, you can turn suppliers from potential vulnerabilities into security partners.

## **Why Your Vendor Network Could Be Your Biggest Risk**

Here’s the reality: most businesses put a lot of effort into securing their own systems but overlook the hidden risks from their vendors and suppliers. Every cloud provider, software tool, or shipping partner with access to your systems is another possible entry point for attackers. The scarier part is that many companies don’t even know exactly who all their vendors are or how much access they really have.

Studies show that more than 60% of organizations experienced a breach through a third party, yet only a third trusted those vendors to report issues. Too often, businesses only find out after the damage is done, and you don’t need us to sound like your mother and remind you that an ounce of prevention is far greater than a pound of cure!

### **Step 1: Know Who’s In Your Circle**

Start by building a live inventory of every vendor who touches your data, systems, and accounts. That means:

- **List them all** — from software apps to suppliers that manage sensitive information

- **Dig deeper** — check who your vendors rely on, because risk can come from multiple layers

- **Keep it current** — review and update your list regularly as relationships change, consider assigning employees to manage your vendors and ongoing updates

### **Step 2: Understand Vendor Risk Levels**

Not all vendors pose the same risk. Your cloud storage provider or payroll service is far riskier than the company that delivers your paper clips.

Classify vendors by:

- **Access level** — who can see sensitive data or infrastructure?

- **Security history** — any past breaches?

- **Certifications** — such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2 (remember, certification is just a starting point and should be verified for ongoing compliance)

### **Step 3: Stay Engaged Year-Round**

Vendor security is not “set it and forget it.” Cyber threats evolve, and yesterday’s safe partner could be today’s weak link.

Best practices:

- **Don’t rely on self-reports** — ask for independent audits, background references, or penetration test results

- **Put it in writing** — include security requirements and breach notification timelines in contracts

- **Monitor activity** — use security tools that watch for suspicious activity or leaked credentials

### **Step 4: Trust but Verify**

Blind trust in your vendors is a gamble you can’t afford.

Make sure to:

- **Require strong protections** — like multi-factor authentication and encryption

- **Limit access** — vendors should only get to the systems and data they truly need

- **Ask for proof** — verify compliance with real reports, not just promises

### **Step 5: Use Zero-Trust Principles**

Zero-Trust means no one gets a free pass — inside or outside your network.

Key actions:

- **Enforce strict authentication** — block outdated logins and require MFA

- **Segment your network** — prevent vendors from freely moving across systems

- **Recheck permissions** — make sure no unnecessary access slips through over time

### **Step 6: Be Ready to Respond**

Even the best security plan can’t guarantee zero incidents. The faster you detect a problem, the less damage it causes.

You can:

- **Watch vendor software updates** for odd changes or suspicious behavior

- **Share threat intelligence** with other trusted organizations

- **Run practice drills** so your team knows how to respond under pressure

### **Step 7: Partner with a Managed IT Provider to Secure your Tech**

For many small businesses, managing all this in-house is unrealistic. That’s where Simple IT comes in.
