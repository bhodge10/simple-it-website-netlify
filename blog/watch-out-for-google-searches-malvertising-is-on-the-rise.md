Malvertising, a form of malware delivered by online advertisements, is on the rise. This dangerous tactic is increasingly targeting small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs), government agencies, and industries like financial services, logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare in Northern Kentucky and beyond. Protecting your business from cyber threats like malvertising is crucial for maintaining compliance, ensuring operational continuity, and locking down the personally identifiable information of your business and your clients. 

## What Is “Malvertising?”

Malvertising involves the use of seemingly legitimate online ads to spread malware or steal sensitive information. For example, during the PlayStation 5 release, hackers exploited the high demand by placing fake ads that led users to malicious websites designed to steal login credentials and payment details. These scams aren’t limited to obscure sites; they can appear on trusted platforms, including Google search results, social media feeds, and reputable websites that have been compromised. 

**Why Is Malvertising More Dangerous Than Ever?**

- **AI-Powered Deception**: Cybercriminals are now using AI to craft highly convincing ads and phishing schemes, making it harder for users to identify scams. 

- **Rising Threat Levels**: According to Malwarebytes, [malvertising incidents increased by 42% month-over-month in the fall of 2023](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/02/malvertising-this-cyberthreat-isnt-on-the-dark-web-its-on-google). 

**Industries at Risk**

Malvertising poses a significant threat to:

- **Financial and Tax Services**: These sectors handle sensitive client data, making them prime targets for credential theft. 

- **Manufacturing and Logistics**: Cyberattacks can disrupt supply chains, causing costly delays and commanding hefty ransoms to prevent lengthy downtime. 

**Healthcare Providers**: With strict regulatory compliance standards, a breach could lead to hefty fines and loss of client trust. 

## Tips for Protecting Yourself from Malicious Online Ads

### Review URLs Carefully

Malvertising often uses slightly altered URLs to mimic legitimate websites. Double-check links before clicking. 

### Visit Websites Directly

Avoid clicking on ads altogether. Instead, navigate directly to a brand’s official website to verify offers or promotions. 

### **Implement DNS Filtering**

A DNS filter can block malicious sites, protecting your business even if an ad is accidentally clicked. 

### **Avoid Logging in After Clicking Ads**

Never input login credentials on a site accessed through an ad. Always verify the website’s legitimacy.

### **Ignore Ad Phone Numbers**

Scammers often include fake phone numbers in their ads. If you’re unsure, contact the company using information from their official website. 

### Don’t Download from Ads

Avoid downloading software or files directly from ads. These downloads often contain malware. 

### **Educate and Alert Your Team**

Share information about malvertising with employees, colleagues, and partners. Building a cyber-aware culture helps mitigate risks.
