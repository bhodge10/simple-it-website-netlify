Cyber hygiene is super important, just like brushing your teeth and making your bed, but for your online life.

Similar to the way daily hygiene keeps you healthy and organized, good cyber hygiene habits help keep you, your devices and your data safe on the internet. Let’s check some easy ways to stay safe online in 2025.

### **What is Cyber Hygiene?**

[Cyber Hygiene](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cyber-hygiene) means the care you give to your online stuff. This includes keeping your devices and information clean and safe. Washing your hands stops germs. Good cyber behavior stops digital germs like viruses and hackers.

### **Why is it Important?**

Criminals who operate online are always trying new tricks to get your info or mess up your gadgets. Good cyber hygiene helps to stop them. It keeps your stuff private and your devices working well.

### **How Can You Improve Your Passwords?**

Passwords are the keys to your online home. You want them to be strong and secure, but also useful and handy when you need them. Here are some tips:

**Use Long Passwords**

Longer passwords are harder to guess. Try using a sentence. For example, “I love eating pizza on Fridays!” may be a password that’s both, yet easy to remember.

**Mix it Up**

Use different types of characters. Mix in numbers, symbols, and both big and small letters. Following our example from above, “I<3EatingPizza0nFridays!” is even more secure.

**Don’t Reuse Passwords**

Use a unique password for each account. If someone steals one, the others stay safe. Maybe “I love eating pizza on Fridays!” for one account while “I love eating ice cream on Fridays!” for another.  Same theme, but different details.

### **Why Should You Update Your Software?**

Updating your software is like giving your computer a flu shot as it helps to protect against new threats. Here’s why software updates are important:

**Fix Security Holes**

Updates usually fix known problems in your software. These are holes that bad guys can use to get in. Updates close these holes.

**Get New Features**

Updates can also give you new cool stuff. Your apps may work better or do more things.

**Set Automatic Updates**

Turn on automatic updates when you can. Then you don’t have to remember to do it.

### **How Does Two-Factor Authentication Work?**

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), is like putting two locks on your door. It makes it harder for bad guys to break in. Here’s how it works:

**What is 2FA?**

2FA needs two things to prove it’s you. Usually, one thing is your password, while the second thing is more unique.  This might be a code sent to your personal mobile phone or email, or it could be a biometric indicator like your fingerprint or facial ID.

**Why Use 2FA?**

With 2FA, if someone were to obtain your password, they still wouldn’t be able to get access. Since they don’t have the second thing they wouldn’t pass the second step of authentication.

**Where to Use 2FA**

Use 2FA on all your important accounts. These include email, banking, and even social media.

### **Are You Being Careful on Public Wi-Fi?**

Public Wi-Fi can be very dangerous. It’s like yelling in a crowded place. Anyone could listen. Here’s some tips to stay safe:

**Using a VPN**

A VPN is like a secret tunnel just for your device to get to the internet. It keeps your information private, even on public Wi-Fi.

**Avoid Sensitive Tasks**

Don’t do banking or shopping on public Wi-Fi. Wait until you’re on a safe network.

**Turn Off Auto-Connect**

Don’t let your device connect to any Wi-Fi network by itself. It may end-up connecting to a fake, or bad, network.

### **How To Identify Phishing Scams?**

Phishing is an attempt to trick you into giving away your information by email. The email could even look like someone you know or a business you should be able to trust, but that’s “the catch”.  Here’s how to avoid the hook:

**Check the Sender and Question their Request**

Look closely at who sent the message. Scammers often use names that look real, but aren’t. They may have also cracked the account of someone you know and want you to believe it’s one of your contacts. In that case, if the email looks “phishy” it’s best to contact that person directly by phone or text to verify if it’s them.  If it’s not really them, they’d probably appreciate knowing they’ve been hacked so they can take action to regain their account!

**Don’t Click Suspicious Links**

If a link looks weird, don’t click it. Hold your mouse over the link until the destination pops up so you can see where it really goes to verify.

**Be Wary of Urgent Messages**

Scammers often say you need to act fast, either by clicking a link to a site or calling a phone number where they’ll request personal or bank data to “verify” it’s you. Real companies rarely do this. If you think it’s really that company, but want to be sure, it may be best to call their customer support directly.

### **Are You Backing Up Your Data?**

Backing up data is like making copies of your important papers to hold in a safe. If something bad happens or you lose the device, you don’t lose everything. Here’s why it’s important:

**Protect Against Ransomware**

Ransomware can lock up your files until something is given or paid to the hacker. With data backups, you’ll have what you need so you won’t be stuck.

**Recover from Accidents**

Sometimes we delete things by mistake. Backups let you get them back.

**Use the 3-2-1 Rule**

Keep 3 copies of your data, on 2 different types of storage, with 1 off-site copy for critical items.

### **How Often Should You Review Your Privacy Settings?**

Your privacy settings are like blinds or curtains on your windows. They let you control what others see. Check them often:

**Schedule It**

Check your privacy settings every few months. Write it down or schedule it in your calendar so you don’t forget.

**Check All Your Accounts**

Don’t forget about old accounts. If you don’t use them, then it’s best to close them or delete them completely.

**Limit What You Share**

Only share what you need to share. The less you share, the safer you are.

### **Are You Teaching Others About Cyber Safety?**

Cyber safety is for everyone and becomes part of a culture when it’s practiced by all. It’s like teaching kids to look both ways before crossing the street when they’re young so they’ll always do it and help others down the road. Here’s how to spread Cyber Safety knowledge:

**Make it Engaging**

Use games or stories to teach about cyber safety. It’s easier to remember that way.

**Lead by Example**

Show good cyber habits to others. They’ll learn by watching you.

**Talk About Online Experiences**

Tell others about online happenings that seem “off”. It can help to keep others safe, while sharing some fun anecdotes, as well.

### **Want to Level Up Your Cyber Hygiene?**

Good cyber hygiene protects you from online bad guys. Use strong passwords, update your software, and be careful on public Wi-Fi. Watch out for phishing scams. Always back up your data. Check your privacy settings and teach others about online safety.
