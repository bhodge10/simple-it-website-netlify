The rise of remote work, virtual assistants, remote IT helpdesk support, virtual CIO’s and a plethora of other outside the office arrangements has redefined the modern workplace. Gone are the days of rigid office schedules and commutes, and in their place instead are mobile device management and remote endpoint monitoring.  But with new flexibility comes new challenges – namely developing a broad threat detection and response plan to defend against cybersecurity threats. Remote work environments often introduce vulnerabilities to your organization's data, network and systems.  

[*73% of executives believe that remote work increases security risk.*](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/)

But this doesn’t mean you can’t mitigate the risk of your IT infrastructure. Below, we’ll equip you with essential security practices for remote teams. You’ll learn how to keep company data safe and secure, and staff well trained with a culture of IT compliance no matter your location. 

## 1. Securing Home Networks

### Strong Wi-Fi Encryption

Ensure that your Wi-Fi is encrypted with the latest security protocols, such as WPA3. This is a foundational step in securing a home network for remote staff. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing your network through a remote location to intercept data. 

### Changing Default Router Settings

Many routers come with default usernames and passwords. These are well-known to cyber criminals. Change these to unique, strong credentials and consider a password management solution (more below) to securely document and maintain control. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your network from a remote endpoint. 

### Regular Firmware Updates

Routers, like any other digital device, need updates to patch security vulnerabilities. Make sure to check for and install firmware updates from the manufacturer. This helps to keep your router secure.

## 2. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

### Password Managers

Remote workers use several accounts and services to access their work. This means managing passwords can be a daunting task. Password managers can generate, store, and autofill complex passwords, eliminating written passwords on sticky notes! This helps ensure each account has a unique and strong password, and the ability to share passwords securely for collaborative tools. 

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Installing MFA adds an extra layer of identity security and access control. Even if a hacker compromises a password, MFA requires a second form of verification. This is usually a text message code or authentication app tied to the end-users mobile device. This second step makes it much harder for attackers to breach accounts. 

## 3. Protecting Devices

### Antivirus/Anti-Malware Software

Ensure that all devices used for work purposes have up-to-date anti-malware software installed. These tools can detect and neutralize threats before they cause significant damage.  Also consider a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution to apply user rules and settings to company owned mobile phones and tablets. 

### Regular Software Updates

Outdated software can have vulnerabilities that are exploited by cybercriminals. To stay protected against the latest threats, enable automatic updates across all your devices for: 

- Operating system, like Microsoft Windows, Google ChromeOS and macOS

- Applications

- Security software for Anti-Virus and Email Spam Detection

### Encrypted Storage

Use encrypted storage like what is found in Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint for sensitive data. This ensures that even if a device is lost or stolen, the data remains inaccessible to hackers. Ven better, with secure cloud storage you’ll have access to your critical data from any device.  You can use both built-in options and third-party solutions.  Also be sure to run frequent data backups, especially in productivity tools like Outlook and Gmail. 

## 4. Secure Communication Channels

### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic. This makes it difficult for attackers to intercept and access your data. Using a reputable VPN service is crucial. Especially when accessing company resources and network security services over public or unsecured networks. 

### Encrypted Messaging and Email

Use encrypted communication tools. These protect the content of your messages and emails. When choosing messaging and email services, be sure to confirm data encryption processes are in-place. This can ensure that your communications remain private and secure. 

## 5. Safe Browsing Practices

### Browser Security

Ensure that your web browser is up-to-date and configured for security. This includes:

- Enabling features such as pop-up blockers

- Disabling third-party cookies

- Using secure (HTTPS) connections whenever possible

### Avoiding Phishing Attacks

Phishing attacks are a common threat to remote workers. Be vigilant about unsolicited emails or any messages asking for sensitive information, regardless of the sender as emails of your contacts could be hacked. Verify the sender’s identity before clicking on links or downloading attachments and even consider calling them directly if anything in an email looks out of line. Report suspicious communications to your IT department or outsourced business IT consultant. Also be sure to have Business Email Antivirus and Spam programs in-place, always on and frequently updated.  This helps others on your team avoid the same emails. 

### Use of Ad Blockers

Ad blockers can prevent malicious ads from displaying on your browser. These often contain malware or phishing links. This adds an extra layer of security while browsing the web. 

## 6. Educating and Training

### Regular Security Training

Continuous education on the latest security practices and threats is essential. This includes phishing simulations, cybersecurity awareness, vulnerability management and best practices for device and data security. Teams should also be aware of any new security protocols to help maintain a strong culture of IT compliance. 

### Incident Response Plan

Put a clear incident response plan in place, including a business continuity plan. This ensures that all employees know what steps to take in the event of a security breach and how to resume business operations swiftly. This should include: 

- Reporting procedures

- Incident remediation and documentation

- Mitigation steps

- Contact information for the IT support team, IT Consultant and your Outsourced IT provider like Simple IT

## 7. Personal Responsibility and Vigilance

### Personal Device Hygiene

Employees should maintain good digital hygiene on their personal devices. This includes regular backups and secure configurations. They should also separate personal and professional activities where possible by way of different user accounts and unique log-ins, or a completely separate device. 

### Being Aware of Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks exploit emotions to gain access to systems and data. Being aware of common tactics, such as pretexting and baiting, where cybercriminals take on the identity of your known contacts. Maintaining a healthy skepticism can prevent falling victim to these spoofing attacks.
