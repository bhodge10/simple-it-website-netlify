Cybersecurity Solutions and Security Awareness Training are challenges for organizations of all sizes. Reported global security incidents grew between February and March of 2024. [They increased by 69.8%](https://www.itgovernanceusa.com/blog/data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2024-in-the-usa). It’s important to use a structured approach to cybersecurity threat detection and response. This helps to protect your organization.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created a Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). It provides an industry-agnostic approach to security and Vulnerability management. It's designed to help companies Cincinnati, Florence, Covington, Fort Mitchell, Fort Wright, Erlanger and across the globe manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks. The framework was recently updated in 2024 to NIST CSF 2.0.

[CSF 2.0 is a comprehensive update](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework) that builds upon the success of its predecessor. It offers a more streamlined and flexible approach to cybersecurity awareness and incident remediation. This guide aims to simplify the framework. As well as make it more easily accessible to small businesses with outsourced IT services and large businesses with Onsite IT support alike.

## Understanding the Core of NIST CSF 2.0

At the heart of CSF 2.0 is the Core. The Core consists of five concurrent and continuous Functions. These are: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These Functions provide a high-level strategic view of cybersecurity risk, as well as an organization's management of that risk. This allows for a dynamic approach to addressing cybersecurity threat detection and response.

Here are the five Core Functions of NIST CSF 2.0:

-

 

-

**Identify**
This function involves identifying and understanding the organization's assets, cyber risks, and vulnerabilities. It's essential to have a clear understanding of what you need to protect. You need Cybersecurity solutions before you can install safeguards.

-

**Protect**
The protect function focuses on implementing safeguards. These protections are to deter, detect, and mitigate cybersecurity risks. This includes measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and data encryption.

-

**Detect**
Early detection of cybersecurity incidents is critical for minimizing damage. The detect function emphasizes the importance of detection measures such as Penetration Testing or Penetration Scanning, as well as having mechanisms to identify and report suspicious activity like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).

-

**Recover**
The recover function focuses on restoring normal operations after a cybersecurity incident. This includes activities such as data restoration, system recovery, and business continuity planning. Every business should have a Data Backup Process, Disaster Recovery Plan and Business Continuity Plan that are documented and regularly reviewed to be ready for swift implementation.

-

**Respond**
The respond function outlines the steps to take in the event of a cybersecurity incident. This includes activities such as containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Conducting a regular IT Security Audit is recommended every few months.

## Profiles and Tiers: Tailoring the Framework

The updated framework introduces the concept of Profiles and Tiers. These help organizations tailor their IT support and cybersecurity remediation practices. They can customize them to their specific needs, risk tolerances, and resources.

#### Profiles

Profiles are the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories. They're aligned with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.

#### Tiers

Tiers provide context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk as well as the processes in place to manage that risk like Cybersecurity Awareness Training, IT Compliance, and Data Encryption. They range from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4).

## Benefits of Using NIST CSF 2.0

There are many benefits to using NIST CSF 2.0, including:

-

 

-

**Improved Cybersecurity Posture:** By following the guidance in NIST CSF 2.0, organizations can develop a more comprehensive and effective cybersecurity solutions and endpoint security programs.

-

**Reduced Risk of Cyberattacks:** The framework helps organizations identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks. This can help to reduce the likelihood of cyberattacks and costly threat remediation.

-

**Enhanced Compliance:** NIST aligned CSF 2.0 with many industry standards and regulations. This can help organizations to meet IT compliance requirements.

-

**Improved Communication:** The framework provides a common language for communicating about cybersecurity risks. This can help to improve communication between different parts of an organization.

-

**Cost Savings:** NIST CSF 2.0 can help organizations save money by staying up to date with proactive elements like vulnerability management, data backup, cybersecurity training and virtual assessments. It does this by preventing cyberattacks and reducing the impact of incidents.

## Getting Started with NIST CSF 2.0

If you are interested in getting started with NIST CSF 2.0, there are a few things you can do:

-

 

-

**Familiarize yourself with the framework:** Take some time to read through the [NIST CSF 2.0 publication](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf). Familiarize yourself with the Core Functions and categories.

-

**Assess your current cybersecurity posture:** Conduct an assessment of your current cybersecurity posture. This will help you identify any gaps or weaknesses. Simple IT offers virtual assessments within the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region.

-

**Develop a cybersecurity plan:** Based on your assessment, we can help you and your company develop a cybersecurity plan. It should outline how you will put in place the NIST CSF 2.0 framework in your organization.

-

**Seek professional help**: Need help getting started with NIST CSF 2.0? Seek out a managed IT services partner. We’ll offer guidance, support and cybersecurity remediation.

By following these steps, you can begin to deploy NIST CSF 2.0 in your organization. At the same time, you'll be improving your cybersecurity posture.
