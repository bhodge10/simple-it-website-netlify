AI may still be a hot topic to the business scene, but most organizations have realized by now that it’s not a sentient system looking to take over the world, but rather an invaluable tool with a range of benefits. Small & Medium Businesses (SMB’s), Non-Profits, and Government Organizations have utilized AI to improve their productivity and efficiency. At **[Simple IT](http://www.simple-it.us)**, we’ve seen AI solutions installed and optimized at an astounding rate. Some are used to automate repetitive tasks and to provide enriched data analysis on a previously unrealized level. While this can certainly boost productivity, it could also be troubling from a data security, privacy, and [cyber threat perspective](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/safety-tips-for-using-ai-at-work-60f6ed72-930b-4830-a055-c3ba81a622ef).

The crux of this conundrum is how the power of AI can be harnessed to capitalize on the benefits it can provide, while eliminating the threat of cybersecurity risks.

## **The Rise of AI**

AI is no longer just a tool for massive enterprises. It’s nearly everywhere now and is a tool available to every organization in some form or another. Cloud-based systems and machine learning APIs have become more affordable and necessary in the modern-day business climate for SMBs.

AI has become common in the following ways:

- Email and meeting scheduling

- Customer service automation

- Sales forecasting

- Document generation and summarization

- Invoice processing

- Data analytics

- Cybersecurity threat detection

AI tools help staff become more efficient, eliminating errors and helping make data-backed decisions. However, organizations need to take steps and set limits which can prevent cybersecurity issues.

## **AI Adoption Risks**

An unfortunate side effect of increasing productivity through the use of AI-based tools is that it also expands the available attack surface for cyber attackers. Organizations must understand that implementing any new technology needs to be done with thoughtful consideration of how it might expose these various threats.

### **Data Leakage**

In order to operate, AI models need data. This can be sensitive customer data, financial information, or proprietary work products. If this information needs to be sent to third-party AI models, there must be a clear understanding of how and when this information will be used. In some cases, AI companies can store it, use it for training, or even leak this information for public consumption.

### **Shadow AI**

Many employees use AI tools for their daily work. This might include generative platforms or online chatbots. Without proper vetting, these [can cause compliance risks](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/03/04/ai-gone-wild-why-shadow-ai-is-your-it-team-s-worst-nightmare).

### **Overreliance and Automation Bias**

Even when using AI tools, it is important for companies to continue their due diligence. Many users consider AI-generated content to always be accurate when, in fact, it is not. Relying on this information without checking it for accuracy can lead to incorrect data, poor decision-making, and undesired outcomes.

### **Secure AI and Productivity**

The steps necessary to secure potential security risks when utilizing AI tools are relatively straightforward.

### **Establish an AI Usage Policy**

It is critical to set limits and guidelines for AI use prior to installing any AI tools.

Be sure to define:

- Approved AI tools and vendors

- Acceptable use cases

- Prohibited data types

- Data retention practices

Educate users regarding the importance of AI security practices and how to properly use the tools installed to minimize the risk associated with using AI tools.

### **Choose Enterprise-Grade AI Platforms**

One way to secure AI platforms is by ensuring that they offer the following:

- GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2 compliant

- Data residency controls

- Do not use customer data for training

- Provide encryption for data at rest and in transit

### **Segment Sensitive Data Access**

Adopting role-based access controls (RBAC) provides better restrictions on data access. It allows access to AI tools only to specific types of information.

### **Monitor AI Usage**

It is essential to monitor AI usage across your organization to understand what information is being accessed and how it is being utilized, including:

- Which users are accessing which tools

- What data is being sent or processed

- Alerts for unusual or risky behavior

## **AI for Cybersecurity**

Ironically, while concerns exist about AI use regarding security issues, one of the primary uses of AI tools is the detection of cyber threats. At Simple IT, AI is actively being used in some of the following ways to **[keep our clients safe, secure, productive and pleased](https://simpleitus.wpcomstaging.com/testimonials/)**!

- Threat detection

- Email phishing deterrent

- Endpoint protection

- Automated response

Adopting AI in tools like Antivirus, Email Filtering, Privileged Access Management, Password Security and Dark Web Monitoring strengthens their ability to detect threats in real-time and to better defend or remediate against cyber incidents.

### **Train Employees About Responsible Use**

An unfortunate truth about humans is that they are, without question, the weakest link in the chain of cyber defense. Even the strongest defensive stance on cyber threats can be undone with a single harmless click by a single unaware user.

It is important for everyone in your organization to receive training regarding the proper use of AI tools and cybersecurity risks, so they’ll understand:

- Risks of using AI tools with company data

- AI-generated phishing

- Recognizing AI-generated content

## **AI With Guardrails**

AI tools can transform any organization’s technical landscape, expanding what’s possible. But productivity without proper protection is a risk you can’t afford. How can AI benefit your operation, and what security vulnerabilities need to be secured before you introduce it?  We can show you the answer to both, and implement the tools to deliver rapid results with real time security monitoring.  **[Contact us today](https://simpleitus.wpcomstaging.com/contact-us/)** for expert guidance, practical toolkits, and all the resources you’ll need to harness AI safely and effectively.
