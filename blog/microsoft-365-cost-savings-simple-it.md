## **Simple IT to Help Businesses Save Money, Work Smart and Stay Secure**

**[Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/what-is-microsoft-365)** and **[Copilot ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview)**can give businesses a tremendous amount of power and benefits. These licenses keep teams connected, support day-to-day operations, offer helpful security tools, and deliver time-saving benefits. The problem is that many organizations spend more than they need to and they miss out on Microsoft 365 cost savings. This happens when licenses go unused, plans are chosen without reviewing real needs, or features overlap without anyone noticing.

The good news is that this can be fixed. When you select **[Simple IT](https://simpleitus.wpcomstaging.com/)**, Northern Kentucky's trusted partner for business technology support, to manage your Microsoft licenses, you gain a team that works to reduce waste, boost security, and make sure you get the most value from the tools you already pay for.  In short, we make sure you only pay for the licenses your business needs, and the licenses your employees will really use.

## **What Microsoft 365 and Copilot Gives You**

Many businesses upgrade too quickly because they are not aware of what they already have. Even without premium add-ons, M365 includes identity protection, multi-factor authentication, safe email scanning, phishing protection, and tools for data retention and activity logging.  Similarly, Copilot is integrated for basic use at no cost across Microsoft’s Office applications like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Teams.

Before moving to higher tier plans, Simple IT can review your existing licenses to identify if everything included matches what’s best for your operation. This prevents spending for features you already have access, or signing up for tools that may sound really cool, but add no real value.

## **Why Businesses Miss Out On Microsoft 365 Cost Savings**

Overspending is common because Microsoft 365 and Copilot licensing can be confusing. Waste often hides in areas that go unnoticed with every monthly billing cycle, and continues to compound if nobody is checking for it.

- **Upgrading Too Soon**

Some companies jump into higher plans or roll out Copilot to every user before they confirm what’s really needed. This can create a larger bill without improving productivity.

- **Unused Licenses**

Employees shift roles or leave the company. If their licenses stay active, you keep paying for them. Over time this adds up to a real financial hit.

- **Offboarding Gaps**

Deleting a user does not remove their license. Without proper steps or automation, businesses continue paying for accounts that are long gone.

- **Duplicate Features**

A single user may be assigned overlapping tools because the admin portal does not warn you about duplicates. This means paying twice for the same capability.

Simple IT checks for all of these issues and corrects them before they drain your technology budget.

## **How Simple IT Reduces Cost and Increases Savings**

**Right-Sizing Your Licensing**

Not every employee needs a high-tier plan or Copilot access. Simple IT reviews usage to see who needs what. Light users and field techs can be given more appropriate plans that still support their specific work, but at a lower cost.  These steps sound simple, but without a consistent plan, many businesses simply miss out on Microsoft 365 cost savings.

**Automated Offboarding**

Our team can assist with automated offboarding, so licenses are removed the moment someone leaves. This prevents unused licenses from piling up.

**Cleaning Up Overlaps**

We look at your security tools, compliance needs, and Copilot usage to make sure you are not paying for the same feature twice. If something already exists in your current plan, we help you avoid buying it again.

**Reviewing Inactive and Shared Mailboxes**

Many businesses pay for licenses on shared mailboxes or old accounts that do not need them. We can convert or archive these so you are only paying for the active, value-generating users.

**Ongoing License Governance**

Simple IT monitors your licensing throughout the year on a monthly basis. We track renewal dates, watch for inactive accounts, and flag potential waste. This ensures your environment stays clean, efficient, and cost-effective.
