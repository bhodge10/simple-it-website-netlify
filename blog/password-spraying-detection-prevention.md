**Password Spraying** is a stealthy type of cyberattack that exploits weak, commonly used passwords across many accounts. Unlike traditional brute-force attacks that hammer a single account with multiple password attempts, password spraying takes one widely used password and tries it across multiple usernames—often avoiding lockout mechanisms and detection systems.

These attacks are especially dangerous for small to mid-sized businesses and government agencies, which may have limited IT resources and inconsistent password policies. This guide explains how password spraying works, how it differs from other attacks, and how your organization can detect, prevent, and respond effectively.

## **What Is Password Spraying?**

[**Password Spraying**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password_Spraying_Attack) is a method cybercriminals use to bypass account lockout policies by attempting the same password across multiple accounts. It targets the human element of cybersecurity—people reusing weak or predictable passwords.

Attackers typically start with a list of usernames, often sourced from public directories or past data breaches. Then, using automation, they try logging in with a handful of common or organization-specific passwords. This allows them to test credentials without triggering alarms.

The simplicity and success rate of this approach make it a favored tactic among cybercriminals, including state-sponsored actors. It’s a growing threat that can give attackers access to sensitive data, compromise networks, or enable further attacks.

## **How Password Spraying Differs from Other Attacks**

**[Traditional Brute-Force Attacks](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/brute-force-attack?srsltid=AfmBOopXgYwXqdbTgyXK4HAzLUQXkzXmIGGY4G267LKPOG9TPsfjIyKz)**

These attacks focus on one account, testing thousands of password combinations rapidly—usually triggering account lockouts and alerts.

**Credential Stuffing**

Credential stuffing uses already stolen username-password pairs, typically from previous breaches. It relies on people reusing the same credentials across platforms.

**Password Spraying**

Password spraying is slower and more discreet. Since it distributes attempts across many accounts using only a few passwords, it's less likely to raise red flags in standard monitoring tools.

### **How to Detect and Prevent Password Spraying**

***1. Enforce Strong Password Policies***

Encourage long, complex, and unique passwords. Use a password manager to help staff create and store secure passwords. Ban weak or common passwords across your systems.

***2. Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)***

MFA adds an essential layer of defense. Even if a password is compromised, attackers still need a second authentication factor, drastically reducing risk.

***3. Monitor Authentication Logs***

Track failed login attempts across all accounts. Repeated failed attempts from the same IP or the same password across multiple usernames should raise alerts.

***4. Audit Security Posture Regularly***

Conduct routine security reviews. Look for vulnerable accounts, outdated policies, and signs of brute-force activity. Keep all systems patched and up to date.

## **Additional Ways to Strengthen Cybersecurity**

#### **Smart Lockout Policies**

Set thresholds to lock accounts temporarily after unusual login behavior, but tailor these settings to avoid impacting legitimate users.

#### **User Education**

Train your team regularly on password security, phishing risks, and MFA. Cybersecurity is most effective when users understand their role in it.

#### **Incident Response Planning**

Have a clear plan in place. If an attack is detected, act quickly: reset passwords, notify affected users, audit access logs, and contain the breach.

## **Protect Your Organization from Password Spraying**

Password spraying remains a serious cybersecurity threat because it preys on human behavior and often goes undetected. But with the right safeguards—strong passwords, MFA, proactive monitoring, and education—your organization can stay protected.
