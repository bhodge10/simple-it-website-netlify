Traveling with technology is a necessity. Whether for work, communication, or entertainment, we are in constant need of our devices. But traveling exposes these gadgets to various risks. Theft, damage, and data loss are common concerns. 

We’ve put together some helpful tips to help mitigate the risk of any tech mishaps on your next trip. Follow these eight best practices for mobile device management to ensure your phones, tablets and laptops remain as safe as possible when traveling. 

## 1. Use Protective Cases

Invest in high-quality protective cases. They shield your gadgets from bumps, drops, and scratches. Look for cases that are sturdy and provide a snug fit for your specific device. For laptops and tablets, consider hardshell cases. For smartphones, use cases that cover the edges and have raised bezels. Tempered glass screen protectors are also a must for cell phones and tables.  Money invested in your case and screen protectors will save you from costly repairs or replacements of your devices and reduce the need for emergency IT support during your travels. 

## 2. Leverage Tracking Apps

Install tracking apps on your devices. These apps help you locate your devices if they are lost or stolen. Many operating systems have built-in tracking features. Enable them before you travel and know how to access them online if needed.  For example, use "Find My" for Apple devices or "Find My Device" for Android. These tools provide the location of your devices and offer remote locking and wiping capabilities, crucial for managed IT services and mobile device management. 

## 3. Keep Devices Close

Always keep your devices within reach. Avoid placing them in checked luggage. Carry them in your personal bag. Use a backpack or a crossbody bag with secure compartments. If you need to leave your device unattended, store it in a hotel safe. The less exposure your gadgets have, the lower the risk of theft or damage, as well as reducing the need for cybersecurity services in the event of a data threat. 

## 4. Use Strong Passwords

Protect your devices with strong passwords. This includes smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Enable two-factor authentication for an added layer of security, as well as biometric log-in when possible. Strong passwords help protect your data and minimize the chances of needing IT incident response services if your device falls into the wrong hands.  Identity and access management through strong passwords and log-in security is considered the #1 way to protect your personal data. 

## 5. Be Cautious with Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks are convenient, but risky. Avoid accessing sensitive information on public networks. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your data, making it harder for hackers to intercept. Turn off automatic connections to public networks and always verify the legitimacy of the Wi-Fi network before connecting to avoid potential network security breaches. 

## 6. Back Up Your Data

Regularly back up your data before you travel with cloud storage or external hard drives. This ensures you won't lose important information if your device is lost or stolen. Set up automatic backups to simplify the process. Backing up your data protects you from data loss and ensures continuity, reducing the need for extensive data recovery services. 

## 7. Be Mindful of Your Surroundings

Stay alert to your surroundings. Crowded places are hotspots for theft. Be particularly cautious in airports, train stations, and tourist attractions. Don’t leave your devices unattended and keep a firm grip on your bag. When using your gadget in public, avoid displaying it for long periods. Awareness and vigilance go a long way in protecting your gadgets and minimizing the need for emergency IT support. 

## 8. Use Anti-Theft Accessories

Invest in anti-theft accessories. These include items like locks and cables for laptops. Anti-theft backpacks have hidden zippers and cut-proof materials, making it difficult for thieves to access your belongings. Consider using RFID-blocking wallets to protect against electronic pickpocketing. Anti-theft accessories provide extra security for your gadgets and can be a crucial part of a comprehensive IT asset management and endpoint security strategy. 

## Extra Considerations

Consider following the additional measures below. They can enhance the safety of your gadgets while traveling. 

### Insure Your Devices

Consider getting insurance for your gadgets. Many mobile device carriers and insurance companies offer policies to cover theft, loss, and damage. Check the coverage details and ensure it fits your needs. Insurance can provide additional financial protection and peace of mind, especially when traveling with expensive devices. 

### Customize Your Device Settings

Before you travel, adjust your device settings for added security. Enable remote wiping capabilities. This allows you to erase your data if a thief steals your device. Turn off Bluetooth and location services when not in use. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and tracking, enhancing your device security. 

### Keep a Record of Your Devices

Document the make, model, and serial numbers of your gadgets. Keep this information in a secure place and be sure it’s part of your data back-up plan. If your device is lost or stolen, these details are useful for reporting, recovery and cyber-insurance claims. 

### Be Prepared for Customs Inspections

Be aware that customs officials may inspect your gadgets. Have them easily accessible in your carry-on luggage. Be ready to turn them on if requested. Ensure your devices are fully charged before you travel and keep your charging accessories with you in the event of unexpected delays. Compliance with customs inspections prevents unnecessary complications or hold-ups. 

## Practical Scenarios

Let's look at some practical scenarios where you can apply these tips.

### Scenario 1: Airport Security

At airport security, remove your laptop from your bag. Place it in a separate bin for screening. Keep a close eye on your belongings as they pass through the X-ray machine. After screening, quickly retrieve and secure your devices before moving on. 

### Scenario 2: Hotel Room

In your hotel room, store your gadgets in the room safe when not in use. If there is no safe, use a portable lockbox. Avoid leaving your devices out in the open, especially when housekeeping is scheduled. This minimizes the risk of theft or unsecure access. 

### Scenario 3: Public Transport

On public transport, keep your gadgets close and secure. Use a bag with anti-theft features. Avoid using your devices near exits where they can be easily snatched. Be discreet when taking out your gadgets and put them away securely after use. Turn off Bluetooth connectivity before entering a ride-share vehicle to prevent unintended data transfer.
