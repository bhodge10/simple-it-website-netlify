The dark web is a hidden part of the internet, inaccessible through traditional search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. To access it, you need specialized software. Unfortunately, this hidden space is where cybercriminals trade stolen data such as passwords, credit card numbers, and sensitive business information.

As a small or mid-sized business in Northern Kentucky or Greater Cincinnati, especially in industries like financial services, manufacturing, logistics, business services, healthcare, or government, preventing your sensitive data from being at risk is critical. If your data ends up on the dark web, you should be the first to know—before it causes harm to others, like your clients and key vendors.

## Why Is Dark Web Monitoring Important?

[Dark Web Monitoring](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/dark-web-monitoring/?srsltid=AfmBOoopg2boa3-CWq1jvDJP-qjWEqUBayR8xa0hWP9CPyNm8_i6jCPD) scans hidden corners of the internet to identify stolen information linked to your business or personal data. This proactive approach ensures you can respond swiftly and proactively to cyber threats.

### **It Protects Your Identity**

Cybercriminals may sell your personal or business information on the dark web. With dark web monitoring, you can detect this early, change passwords, and secure your accounts before damage escalates.

### **It Safeguards Your Business**

For industries like logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare, protecting customer data and proprietary information is critical. Dark web monitoring can alert your business to breaches, enabling quick action to limit exposure and maintain customer trust.

## **How Does Dark Web Monitoring Work?**

Dark web monitoring employs specialized tools and technologies to scan the dark web in real time for stolen information, including:

- Email Addresses

- Passwords

- Credit Card Numbers

- Social Security Numbers

### **AI-Powered Protection**

Many monitoring tools leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to perform faster, more precise scans, detecting complex patterns of cybercriminal activity that could otherwise go unnoticed.

### **Real-Time Alerts**

When stolen data is detected, these tools send immediate alerts so you can take action right away.

## **What Can Dark Web Monitoring Find?**

Dark web monitoring can uncover a variety of compromised data types, such as:

- Login credentials

- Credit card and bank account numbers

- Personal identification information (e.g., Social Security Numbers)

## **Is Dark Web Monitoring Enough?**

While dark web monitoring is a powerful tool, it’s not a complete solution. Here are additional steps to enhance your cybersecurity:

- **Use Strong Passwords & Password Managers**: Create unique, complex passwords for every account with scheduled updates.  Utilize a Password Manager to simplify the complexities of password management, as well the safekeeping of other critical datapoints like access codes, account numbers, credit cards and more.

- **Limit Online Sharing**: Avoid oversharing personal information on social media or other platforms.

- **Keep Systems Updated with MFA Enabled**: Regularly update your software to close security vulnerabilities, and always enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), when possible, for a two-step authentication process to confirm access.

## **How Can You Get Dark Web Monitoring?**

While some banks and credit card companies offer very basic dark web monitoring for free which can be helpful for an individual account’s use, it’s not advised for business accounts based on the significant difference of risk and targeting.

### **Managed Services from IT Experts**

Simple IT provides comprehensive enterprise level dark web monitoring solutions which can be tailored to suit small and mid-sized businesses. These solutions are designed to protect sensitive data across a range of industries like financial services, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, and many others, as well as government agencies.

## **How Often Should You Check for Dark Web Alerts?**

Regular monitoring is key to staying ahead of cyber threats, and frankly it can’t be checked often enough as the damage can be immediate once data is exposed on the Dare Web. This is why, at Simple IT, we both use and recommend automated services which provide constant monitoring and real-time alerts for maximum protection.

## **What Should You Do if Your Data Is Found on the Dark Web?**

If your information is discovered, follow these steps immediately:

- **Change Your Passwords**: Update credentials for all affected accounts with strong, unique passwords.  Also update accounts where the same password may be duplicated.

- **Monitor Financial Accounts**: Check bank statements and credit reports for suspicious activity. Notify your account provider of the occurrence and provide details of any suspicious activity.  Even if nothing substantial is found, alerting your provider is advised so they can proactively monitor your accounts.

- **Freeze Your Credit and Update Credit Cards**: Prevent identity thieves from using your account, opening new accounts in your name, and wiping out accounts.  Credit bureaus, including Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, should also be alerted so they can monitor your credit identity for suspicious activity.

- **Consult your IT and Cyber Security Provider:**  Much like a home inspector can apply specific tools and processes to find weak points in a home’s foundation, roof, plumbing or mechanical systems; your IT and Cyber Security provider can uncover vulnerabilities in your technical landscape to swiftly remediate incidents and prevent future occurrences.

## **Is Dark Web Monitoring Worth It?**

For businesses and individuals, dark web monitoring is an invaluable tool for safeguarding sensitive information. It provides early warnings of data breaches, allowing you to take fast action and minimize risk. The cost for implementing solutions which can prevent an incident from occurring is a minimal fraction of the extensive costs a business would incur in damages and penalties once an incident has taken place.
