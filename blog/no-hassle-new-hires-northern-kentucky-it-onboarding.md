There’s nothing more awkward for a new hire than showing up for their first day on the job and spending it filling out forms, waiting for login credentials to arrive, and sitting alone and uncomfortable trying to fit in at a new place. It's a clunky start that wastes a lot of time and leaves a bad impression.

Unfortunately, it’s more common than you think. According to Gallup, [only 12% of employees feel their company does a great job with onboarding](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/235121/why-onboarding-experience-key-retention.aspx). That’s a big opportunity for improvement, and thankfully, technology can help you fix it for your Northern Kentucky business.

With the right IT support, you can set your small business apart from the others by turning a traumatic first day into a smooth, welcoming experience for both your new hire and your HR team.

## **Why Onboarding Matters More Than Ever**

The interviewing and hiring process is commonly a costly and time intensive operation for businesses, government agencies and non-profits. You want that hard work and time to pay off with a great hire who can feel at home and get rolling quickly. The first 90 days are a make-or-break window to nail that goal. Nearly [one in three employees who quit during their first six months say poor onboarding was a big reason for leaving](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/onboarding-key-to-retaining-engaging-talent), according to SHRM. When you have to do it all over again to replace a new hire who leaves, it’s a doubly expensive outcome just to find yourself right back where you started.

Let’s agree not to let that happen anymore. A solid onboarding plan builds new hire confidence, increases retention, and gets people contributing faster. IT, automation and technology can play a major part in making all of that happen.

## **Why Traditional Onboarding Feels So Frustrating**

Most onboarding setups are a mess and not well structured. New hires get bombarded with paperwork, login issues, vague instructions, and long waits for the tools they need before they can ever get to work. Meanwhile, HR and IT are stuck (and possibly ready to pull knives on one-another) as they juggle repeat tasks and fix access problems.

Here’s what usually gets in the way:

- Piles of paperwork and duplicate forms

- Confusing instructions with no clear path forward

- Different departments doing similar things in different ways

- Poor communication of what’s needed and missed deadlines

- Delayed access to hardware, data, systems, and software

The good news is that every one of these problems can be solved with Simple IT support.

## **5 Ways Simple IT Can Assist to Upgrade Your Onboarding Process**

### **1. Start Things Off with Preboarding**

The moment someone says “yes” to the job, the onboarding experience should begin.

With managed services from Simple IT, you can automatically send out welcome emails, directions for internal set-up of logins, and even ship a computer and phone with everything installed and ready to go. Your new hire can open the box, power-up, log in, and feel ready from day one… while their eager and excited to show you that you’ve made a good choice bringing them in to your operation!

Here’s what a preboarding checklist might include:

- Company email setup

- Digital forms handled online

- Welcome videos, office walk-throughs, and other “basic training” items

- A clear schedule of what they’ll expect on their first day or week

- Slack or Teams invites to begin meeting and communicating with coworkers

This approach clears away the boring stuff so the first day can focus on real connections.

### **2. Automate the Tedious Work**

Nobody wants to spend hours copying employee info into five different systems. That’s where automation comes in.

With the right IT tools, you can automatically handle:

- Data entry into HR platforms

- Compliance and policy signoffs

- Background checks

- Reminder emails for missing documents

Less busy-work means HR has more time to welcome people and focus on them as the valuable person you want them to be, instead of babysitting processes.

### **3. Make Training Less Boring, More Useful**

Old-school training manuals are a thing of the past. Today’s learning platforms make training faster and more engaging with videos, quizzes, and short lessons.

A managed IT provider can help you:

- Set up learning platforms tailored to job roles and locations

- Track progress automatically with reminders to ensure completion

- Make training more immersive, memorable and mobile-friendly

- Assign the right lessons to the right people

When training is done well, people learn faster and feel more confident putting what they learned to use.

### **4. Put Everything in One Place**

Instead of hunting through email threads or trying to remember which folder had the HR manual, give new hires a central onboarding hub.

With IT support, you can build a centralized portal or data file that holds:

- Company policies and HR forms

- Training links, videos and documents

- Schedules and contact info

- Secure access with a single login

Whether they’re in the office or working remotely, everything is in one spot and easy to find with no lost time digging around or having to make repeated asks.

### **5. Use Analytics to Improve the Process**

Want to know what’s working and what’s not? Modern IT systems can give you real data.

With onboarding analytics, you can track:

- Time it takes for new hires to complete onboarding steps and be productive

- Completion success rates of what they learned and remembered from training

- Drop-off or pain points in the process so they can be ironed out

- Satisfaction feedback from new hires to continually improve your process

These insights help you fine-tune and evolve your onboarding program, as well see what’s making a difference or just wasting time.

## **Make It Personal (Because It Should Be)**

Not every employee needs the same kind of onboarding. Some want to dive right in, while others prefer more structure and support. Good IT makes it easy to offer both.

You can customize the experience based on:

- Job role or department

- Previous experience

- Learning style

Maybe that includes assigning a mentor, sending a questionnaire for the new-hire to share helpful info and have a hand in their onboarding, or suggesting a time-based skill path which will benefit them for their specific role. When onboarding feels personal, it shows you care, because you’re valuing the individual to be an active participant.

## **Help Busy Managers Stay Involved Without Dropping the Ball**

Managers play a big part in new hire success, but their schedules are full too. That’s where IT can keep things moving.

You can set up tools that:

- Send reminders for 30, 60, and 90-day check-ins

- Assign onboarding tasks or training videos to be sent automatically

- Collect feedback from both sides

It’s like a digital and dynamic checklist to keep everything on track.

## **The Bottom Line: Simple IT Makes Great Onboarding Possible**

The first week on the job doesn’t have to be confusing, frustrating, or filled with awkward delays that leave your valuable new-hire second guessing their decision to join your team. With the right IT support in place, you’ll be a best rated Northern Kentucky business who shows staff and future employees you care, with a smart onboarding process that’s fast, friendly, secure, and stress-free.
