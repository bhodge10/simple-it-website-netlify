As the [Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System is currently only 6 months away from its end of support date (October 14, 2025),](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro) we’re helping many partners refresh their tech and transition to Windows 11.  With this being a large undertaking for businesses big and small, and from Northern Kentucky to across the globe, we’re getting asked more than ever how we feel about finding value from pre-owned technology (sometimes referred to as Renewed, Refurbished or simply Used), compared to more expensive new technology. Similar to automobiles, buying a used, refurbished, or renewed device can be an attractive alternative to save money; but, there are some key factors which need to be considered in order to best ensure you're getting a reliable, secure, and functional device, rather than a lemon which could cost a whole lot more in the long-run. So, we’ve come-up with 8 important things the Simple IT team looks for when shopping pre-owned technology for business use.

## **8 Things to Consider Before Buying Used Technology**

The market for used business technology is booming, with an estimated [70% of consumers reported having bought or sold used devices in 2023](https://www.mpb.com/en-us/content/latest-from-mpb/over-70-per-cent-consumers-bought-sold-used-2023). As this pre-owned tech market continues to grow, [predicted to hit $2.7 trillion by 2025](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/us-tech-spending-defies-the-economic-slowdown-to-hit-2-7-trillion-in-2025/), it’s crucial to approach refurbished or renewed technology purchases with caution. Whether you're looking for laptops, desktops, tablets, phones, or IT office hardware for your small business or government agency, keep these 8 things in mind.

### **1. Is the Device Still Supported by the Manufacturer, and Does it Meet Operating System Requirements?**

Before purchasing a used tech device, check if it still receives software and security updates or drivers, as well that it meets the minimum requirements for the latest version of its operating system. ([See Windows 11 System Hardware Requirements Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications?r=1)). Devices that can no longer receive hardware and operating system updates will expose your business to increased cybersecurity risks. Security patches are crucial for protecting against viruses, malware and other potential cyberattacks. Always verify the support status on the manufacturer’s website to ensure your used device remains secure and functional over time, and check with the operating system developer to confirm the device will be supported for OS updates. Devices which are past their support dates may look to be a tremendous value, but if the price looks too good to be true, then it may be an indication of a cost that will hit you later with increased exposure to security risks which could not only render the device useless, but exposure your entire business network, as well.

### **2. Device Age and Longevity**

The age of a used device is a key factor in its performance. While new devices and their pricy rates come with better performance and longer lifespans, older devices may experience slower processing speeds and compatibility issues when running newer software. Check the model’s release date and compare it with the latest models to determine if it meets your needs in terms of business productivity, and be sure to confirm if key software you use has minimum or recommended hardware specifications. This is a helpful way to determine if the savings of a renewed device may cost you later in lagging or insufficient performance.

### **3. Battery Health and Lifespan**

Battery health is often a deal-breaker when purchasing used technology. If a device has a low battery capacity, it may need frequent charging, which can disrupt productivity. Ensure the battery is in good condition and inquire not only about the cost of a replacement battery, but the labor cost for that service, as well. Factor this and any other updates or warranty coverages into the total cost of the device to understand how it may impact the total cost of ownership when compared to a new device.

### **4. Check for Visible Damage or Wear**

Physical damage to a device may not just be cosmetic; it could also affect its performance. Look for signs of cracks, dents, water damage, and other indicators of over-use which could signal underlying hardware or internal component issues. Visible damage may indicate previous mishandling or increase the likelihood of internal issues which could severely compromise the device’s functionality, operating safety and security.

### **5. Are All Essential Accessories Included?**

Before finalizing your purchase, confirm all essential accessories are included with the device. Chargers, cables, keyboard, mice, monitors and other peripherals can sometimes be missing in used devices, adding hidden costs you’ll absorb later on. It’s also advised to confirm if high-touch accessories like keyboards, mice, protective cases, and headphones are pre-used.  Less than reputable sellers try to give the impression of extra items for added value, but there are some things where new condition is non-negotiable.

### **6. What’s the Warranty and Return Policy?**

Make sure the used device comes with a clearly stated time frame for its warranty and return policy. If something goes wrong, having a warranty to protect, replace or repair your device, and an easy method to return it for refund can help mitigate potential risks. You don’t want to be without a device for an extended period, or worse yet, having paid to be stuck with a device which doesn’t work as planned.  This is particularly critical for businesses relying on technology for daily operations of their work staff where a delay or lost production of a day or two could far exceed the cost of a new device.

### **7. Compare Prices to New Devices**

Pricing comparison is essential to ensure you’re getting the best deal. Sometimes, after factoring in earlier mentioned factors, purchasing a brand new device may not cost much more than a renewed one. Compare prices from various sellers to ensure you’re not overpaying for a pre-owned device. Whether buying pre-owned, used, refurbished or new technology, the goal is to be sure you’re getting the best value for your investment which means a device that performs great for a fair price.

### **8. Can You Test the Device Before You Buy?**

It’s always wise to confirm a testing window for used technology before being committed to it, especially when buying from a peer-to-peer or eCommerce marketplace. This may be covered in the warranty or return policy where 90 days is considered minimum industry standard.  This will allow you or the employee using the equipment sufficient time to confirm the equipment works properly and as expected, and a clear understanding with the seller of how to return or repair the equipment if it’s not.

## **Conclusion: Is Buying Used Technology Right for Your Business?**

While buying refurbished, renewed, or pre-owned technology can offer considerable cost savings for fully-functional equipment, there is the potential for additional risk when compared to new devices.  It’s important to make sure the device meets your business's functional needs, as well as you’re your security requirements. Consider factors such as battery health, manufacturer and operating system support & updates, device condition, and warranty & return policies before making a purchase. A device that fits your user and security requirements and is priced right, may be a great deal; but, one that’s too good of a deal may significantly hurt you and your business.
