    <h3>5.1 Response Time Guarantee</h3>

    <h3>5.5 SLA Credits</h3>

    <p>In providing services, we may access, process, or store your data. We will handle your data in accordance with our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and applicable laws.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Data Backup and Recovery</h3>
    <p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to backup your data as part of our services. However:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>We will assist with data retrieval and transition at no charge</li>
        <li>If third-party storage providers (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure) charge fees for data retrieval or storage, we will pass those costs to you</li>
        <li>After 30 days, all backup data will be securely deleted unless other arrangements are made</li>
        <li>You may request immediate data deletion at any time</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>6.5 Security Measures</h3>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h3>7.1 Ownership of Documentation</h3>
    <p>Network documentation, system diagrams, and infrastructure records we create for you are owned by you, the Client. We retain copies for service delivery purposes and will return or destroy them upon termination.</p>

    <h3>7.2 Proprietary Tools and Scripts</h3>
    <p>Any custom scripts, automation tools, or proprietary software we develop remain the intellectual property of Simple IT. We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use these tools during the term of our service relationship.</p>

    <h3>7.3 Third-Party Licenses</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses for third-party software and services. We are not liable for your use of unlicensed or improperly licensed software.</p>

    <h3>7.4 Use of Client Logo and Name</h3>

        <li><strong>WARRANTIES OF COMPLETE SECURITY OR PROTECTION AGAINST ALL THREATS</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.3 No Guarantee of Results</h3>
    <p>We make commercially reasonable efforts to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain system uptime and availability</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent security threats</li>
        <li>Backup and protect data</li>
        <li>Respond quickly to issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, we do not guarantee 100% uptime, complete protection against all security breaches, or successful recovery from all failures. Technology services involve inherent risks and limitations.</p>

    <h3>8.4 Cybersecurity Assessment Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>For cybersecurity assessments and security services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not warrant that all vulnerabilities will be discovered</li>
        <li>Security threats evolve rapidly, and new vulnerabilities emerge constantly</li>
        <li>We will address identified vulnerabilities within 30 days if you approve the recommended remediation</li>
        <li>Your security posture depends on many factors beyond our control, including user behavior and third-party systems</li>
